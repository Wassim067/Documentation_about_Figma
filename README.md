## 1. Introduction

Start by creating an account on the Figma website. You can do this here: Figma.com.

Get started ->


![github-small](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97837907/198827043-0eacf236-0d3e-4a57-80a2-16156bcd303b.png)


After registering, you will be on the main page where you will have the option to create new designs or teams that will allow you to work on your design with three other people.

New designe file ->

After creating a new draft, you will be taken to the design view. This is where you spend 99% of the time when creating a mockup.

- Orange => here you can rename the file 
- Violet => Tool menu 
- Yellow => and here you can change the background color of your work surface, as it is more comfortable for you. (I recommend light gray)




## 2. Frames in Figma

The first thing you do is create a frame, which is like a basic structure for our design. Depending on your requirements, you can freely choose the size of a frame.

- Red => Select the Frame tool from the top menu
- Green => Select the Frame size on the right panel




## 3. Grids and Columns

Before starting with the design, add grids that will help to keep the alignment of the content of the page consistent.

Add grids to a frame and customize them on the right panel.

- Select the frame you wish to grid
- Select Layout Grid on the right panel
- Select Columns (I recommend setting the count to 12 for desktops and 5 for mobile apps.)

## 4. How to use shapes

In Figma, use shapes and elements to create squares, circles, lines, and more. This is the essentials for creating a design on a page.

In the right pannel, the shapes can be edited completely. What was previously a circle can be shaped like a C. Figma offers an infinite number of possibilities. 

- Select the shape tool from the tool menu and click on the shape you need
- then drag the shape in the layout 
- at the end you can edit the form as you like

## 5. Colors

Again figma gives you the opportunity to give space to your creativity.

If you select the fill section on the right panel you can mix colors, select transparency or add borders.

## 6. How to add images in Figma

Images from an online or local source can be added to the page. Images are an important part of website design.

- Drag and drop an image from you local computer
- Import an image from the shapes image upload option
- Resize and place the image on the design

## 7. How to add text

To add text to a design, select the text tool and place it on the page. The default font is Roboto, but you can change the font family, size and color at any time.
Use the right panel to change the color and size of the font, and later the font family as well.

- Select the Text tool
- Add the text on the frame 
- then you can edit your text on the right panel

## 8. Label elements and create groups

Working with many layers in Figma can be disorienting, so be sure to label all of your elements as you create them. It's even better if you group different sections and shapes with labels.

- Select your element/s and right click to group or press Ctrl + G
- Name your group
- Places groups inside groups for each section of your page to improve readability once your page gets large

Figma is a versatile design program, which you can easily learn to use. I hope that I could help you with it for the beginning.
